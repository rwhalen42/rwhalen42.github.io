**My name is Ryan Whalen** and I recently graduated from Virginia Tech in the spring of 2020 with a B.S. in Environmental Informatics. I'm an R enthusiast with an interest in data science, geospatial analysis, and business analytics. 

**I love to solve problems**. Whether it's finding the most efficient way to write a line of code or figuring out how to develop eco-friendly electric dirtbikes, I love the challenge of *finding creative solutions*. The satisfaction that comes from using creative solutions to discover knowledge from large datasets is why I believe I'm fascinated by data science and geospatial analytics. As long as there's a problem to solve or a challenge to puzzle over, it's bound to be something I love.
